      <h3>Ingredients & Substitutions</h3>
      <p class="Homepage-ingredients">
        Flour:
        <br />
        I use bread flour for croissants. I haven‚Äôt tested this with all-purpose
        flour but to be honest, I‚Äôve never had any bread recipes give me major
        problems when I subbed in all-purpose flour so it should be fine.
        <br />
        Bread Flour has more gluten so it will give it a better structure and
        more of a chewy texture.
        <br />
        As always I recommend weighing your ingredients with a digital scale,
        especially flour.
        <br />
        Sugar:
        <br />
        I used granulated sugar in the dough. The sugar lightly sweetens the
        dough and makes it a little more tender. It also helps with browning. I
        don‚Äôt recommend swapping it, but the recipe does work well if you want
        to reduce it a little.
        <br />
        Yeast:
        <br />
        Instant yeast or active dry yeast works fine. Just sub for equal
        amounts.
        <br />
        Salt:
        <br />
        I like fine sea salt. Water: I like using cool water, it makes the dough
        a little less sticky.
        <br />
        Butter:
        <br />
        I recommend a good, high quality butter with high fat content like Kerry
        Gold, Danish Creamery European Butter, Plugra. The highest butterfat you
        can find would be best. I have not tested this with dairy free butter
        but if the butterfat content is over 80% then you should be good.
