    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      Ingredients & Substitutions Flour: I use bread flour for croissants. I
      haven’t tested this with all-purpose flour but to be honest, I’ve never
      had any bread recipes give me major problems when I subbed in all-purpose
      flour so it should be fine. Bread Flour has more gluten so it will give it
      a better structure and more of a chewy texture. As always I recommend
      weighing your ingredients with a digital scale, especially flour. Sugar: I
      used granulated sugar in the dough. The sugar lightly sweetens the dough
      and makes it a little more tender. It also helps with browning. I don’t
      recommend swapping it, but the recipe does work well if you want to reduce
      it a little. Yeast: Instant yeast or active dry yeast works fine. Just sub
      for equal amounts. Salt: I like fine sea salt. Water: I like using cool
      water, it makes the dough a little less sticky. Butter: I recommend a
      good, high quality butter with high fat content like Kerry Gold, Danish
      Creamery European Butter, Plugra. The highest butterfat you can find would
      be best. I have not tested this with dairy free butter but if the
      butterfat content is over 80% then you should be good.
